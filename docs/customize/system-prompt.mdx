## Overview

You can customize the system prompt by extending the `SystemPrompt` class. Internally, this adds extra instructions to the default system prompt.

<Note>
  Custom system prompts allow you to modify the agent's behavior at a
  fundamental level. Use this feature carefully as it can significantly impact
  the agent's performance and reliability.
</Note>

## Basic Customization

Create a custom system prompt by inheriting from the base class.

```python
from browser_use import SystemPrompt
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage
from overrides import overrides
class MySystemPrompt(SystemPrompt):
    @overrides
    def get_system_message(self) -> SystemMessage:
        
        # Get existing rules from parent class
        existing_prompt = self.prompt_template.format(max_actions=self.max_actions_per_step)

        # Add your custom rules
        new_prompt = """
            10. MOST IMPORTANT RULE:
            - You must response, think, reason Only Korean
            - You must find "ReactModal__Overlay" attribute when you search sections
            - You must search another apporach, another section, another actions even you faced retry the situations over twice times
        """

        # Make sure to use this pattern otherwise the exiting rules will be lost
        return SystemMessage(content=f'{existing_prompt}\n{new_prompt}')

```

## Using Custom System Prompt

Apply your custom system prompt when creating an agent:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize the model
model = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o')

# Create agent with custom system prompt
agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=model,
    system_prompt_class=MySystemPrompt
)
```
